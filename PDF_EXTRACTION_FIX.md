# PDF Extraction Reliability Fix

## Problem
PDFの内容を正しく読み込んでくれる場合もあるが、PDFの中身が空だと判断される場合もある (PDF content was sometimes correctly read but sometimes detected as empty)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added PyMuPDF Library
- Installed PyMuPDF (also known as fitz) which has superior Japanese text extraction capabilities
- Added to pyproject.toml dependencies
- Rebuilt Docker containers with new dependency

### 2. Enhanced Multi-Method Extraction
The document processor now tries three different PDF libraries in order:

1. **PyMuPDF** (Primary)
   - Best performance with Japanese text
   - Handles complex PDF structures well
   - Proper Unicode support

2. **pdfplumber** (Secondary)
   - Good alternative for Japanese PDFs
   - Handles tables and structured content

3. **PyPDF2** (Fallback)
   - Basic extraction when others fail
   - Widely compatible

### 3. Improved Error Handling and Logging
- Added detailed logging at each extraction step
- File size logging to detect empty uploads
- Page-by-page extraction status
- Success/failure logging for each method
- Japanese error messages for user feedback

### 4. Text Validation
- Check for both null and empty strings
- Strip whitespace before validation
- Ensure proper UTF-8 encoding for all text

### 5. Error Messages
- "PDFからテキストを抽出できませんでした。スキャンされたPDFの可能性があります。" (Could not extract text from PDF. It might be a scanned PDF.)
- "PDFファイルが破損しているか、暗号化されています。" (PDF file is corrupted or encrypted.)
- "PDFの処理に失敗しました" (Failed to process PDF)

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the fix works correctly:

1. Test with various Japanese PDF types:
   - Text-based PDFs (職務経歴書、履歴書)
   - PDFs with mixed content (text + images)
   - PDFs from different sources (MS Word exports, web downloads)

2. Monitor the logs during upload:
   ```bash
   docker logs -f ai-carrer-discovery-assistant-backend-1
   ```

3. Look for extraction success messages:
   - "PyMuPDF SUCCESS: Total extracted X characters"
   - "pdfplumber SUCCESS: Total extracted X characters"
   - "PyPDF2 SUCCESS: Total extracted X characters"

## Known Limitations

1. **Scanned PDFs**: The system cannot extract text from scanned/image-based PDFs without OCR
2. **Encrypted PDFs**: Password-protected PDFs cannot be processed
3. **Corrupted PDFs**: Damaged PDF files will fail extraction

## Future Enhancements

1. Add OCR support for scanned PDFs using libraries like:
   - Tesseract with Japanese language pack
   - Google Cloud Vision API
   - Amazon Textract

2. Add PDF preview functionality to show users what was extracted

3. Add support for more document formats:
   - RTF files
   - Plain text files
   - OpenDocument formats
