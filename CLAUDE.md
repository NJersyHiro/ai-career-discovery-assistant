## Project Overview

AI Career Discovery Assistant is a web service that analyzes users' resumes, CVs, and skill sheets to reveal hidden career potential and generate personalized pathways for diverse career transitions. The initial focus is on the Japanese market with plans for global expansion.

## Key Business Context

1. **Target Market**: Japan (initial), with focus on:
   - Japanese resume (履歴書) and CV (職務経歴書) formats
   - Integration with Japanese online course platforms
   - Compliance with Japan's Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI)

2. **Core Features**:
   - Document upload and NLP-powered content extraction
   - Career path generation across three categories: corporate transitions, freelancing, entrepreneurship
   - Skill gap analysis with learning recommendations
   - Market salary data integration (Phase 3)

## Development Phases

### Phase 1 (MVP)
- Document upload system (PDF/Word)
- NLP-powered content extraction optimized for Japanese formats
- Basic career path generation
- Results dashboard with skill mapping

### Phase 2 (Enhanced Analysis)
- Advanced skill gap analysis
- Platform integrations
- Business model templates
- User feedback system

### Phase 3 (Premium Features)
- Market salary data
- Qualification relevance analysis
- Mentor network connections
- Progress tracking

## Technical Considerations

1. **Language Support**: Must gracefully handle Japanese language documents as priority
2. **Mobile-Responsive**: Design for on-the-go access
3. **Data Privacy**: Clear messaging and APPI compliance
4. **Performance**: Quick analysis time with progress indicators

## Success Metrics to Consider

- 50% activation rate (users completing upload within first week)
- 4.0/5.0 satisfaction score on recommendation relevance
- NPS of +20 within 6 months
