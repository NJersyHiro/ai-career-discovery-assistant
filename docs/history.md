● 🎉 Phase 1 Foundation Complete!

  I've successfully implemented the foundation for the AI Career Discovery Assistant project:

  ✅ Completed Tasks:

  1. Project Structure - Clean architecture with separation of concerns
  2. Frontend Setup - React + TypeScript + Vite with Japanese UI support
  3. Backend Setup - FastAPI with async support and Gemini API integration
  4. Docker Configuration - Full development environment with all services

  🔑 Key Features Implemented:

  Frontend:
  - React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
  - Ant Design for Japanese-friendly UI components
  - Vite for fast development builds
  - React Router for navigation
  - Zustand for state management
  - React Query for efficient API data fetching

  Backend:
  - FastAPI with async/await support
  - SQLAlchemy 2.0 with proper models
  - Gemini API Integration for resume analysis
  - JWT-based authentication
  - Document processing (PDF/DOCX)
  - Celery for background tasks
  - S3/MinIO for file storage

  📝 Next Steps:

  To run the development environment:

  1. Copy and configure environment variables:
  cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
  # Edit backend/.env and add your GEMINI_API_KEY

  2. Start all services:
  make dev
  # Or use docker-compose up -d

  3. Run database migrations:
  make db-migrate

  4. Access the applications:
  - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
  - Backend API: http://localhost:8000
  - API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/docs
  - MinIO Console: http://localhost:9001 (minioadmin/minioadmin)

  The project is now ready for the next phase of development. The Gemini API is integrated
  and will be used to analyze Japanese resumes (履歴書) and CVs (職務経歴書) as specified.
