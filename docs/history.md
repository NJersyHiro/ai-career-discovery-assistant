‚óè üéâ Phase 1 Foundation Complete!

  I've successfully implemented the foundation for the AI Career Discovery Assistant project:

  ‚úÖ Completed Tasks:

  1. Project Structure - Clean architecture with separation of concerns
  2. Frontend Setup - React + TypeScript + Vite with Japanese UI support
  3. Backend Setup - FastAPI with async support and Gemini API integration
  4. Docker Configuration - Full development environment with all services

  üîë Key Features Implemented:

  Frontend:
  - React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
  - Ant Design for Japanese-friendly UI components
  - Vite for fast development builds
  - React Router for navigation
  - Zustand for state management
  - React Query for efficient API data fetching

  Backend:
  - FastAPI with async/await support
  - SQLAlchemy 2.0 with proper models
  - Gemini API Integration for resume analysis
  - JWT-based authentication
  - Document processing (PDF/DOCX)
  - Celery for background tasks
  - S3/MinIO for file storage

  üìù Next Steps:

  To run the development environment:

  1. Copy and configure environment variables:
  cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
  # Edit backend/.env and add your GEMINI_API_KEY

  2. Start all services:
  make dev
  # Or use docker-compose up -d

  3. Run database migrations:
  make db-migrate

  4. Access the applications:
  - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
  - Backend API: http://localhost:8000
  - API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/docs
  - MinIO Console: http://localhost:9001 (minioadmin/minioadmin)

  The project is now ready for the next phase of development. The Gemini API is integrated
  and will be used to analyze Japanese resumes (Â±•Ê≠¥Êõ∏) and CVs (ËÅ∑ÂãôÁµåÊ≠¥Êõ∏) as specified.


‚óè ‚úÖ Migration Issue Fixed!

  I've fixed the migration issue and added proper development scripts. Here are your options
  to run the migrations:

  Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

  ./scripts/run-migrations.sh

  Option 2: Using Docker Compose directly

  # Start the database
  docker-compose up -d db

  # Run migrations in a temporary container
  docker-compose run --rm backend alembic upgrade head

  Option 3: Local Python environment

  cd backend
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  alembic upgrade head

  The project now includes:
  - requirements.txt for easier dependency management
  - setup-dev.sh script for automated environment setup
  - run-migrations.sh script for easy migration execution
  - Initial database schema migration
  - Updated README with clear instructions

  The database schema is now ready with tables for:
  - Users (authentication)
  - Documents (uploaded resumes/CVs)
  - Analyses (Gemini API results)
  - Career Recommendations (parsed career paths)

  Don't forget to add your GEMINI_API_KEY to backend/.env before starting the application!
