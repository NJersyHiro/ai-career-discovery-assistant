Sato-san, a 32-year-old marketing manager, uploads her 職務経歴書 on a quiet Sunday evening. She's been feeling restless at work but doesn't know what her options are. Within minutes, the AI reveals opportunities she never considered: her skills could translate into freelance marketing strategy consulting, or she could launch a SaaS tool for small businesses. The platform shows her that freelance strategists in her area earn ¥8,000-¥15,000 per hour and provides a learning roadmap to fill two skill gaps. By Wednesday, she's enrolled in a digital analytics course and is drafting a proposal for her first potential client. For the first time in months, she feels excited about her professional future.
